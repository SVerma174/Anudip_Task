n=int(input("enter the number :"))          ## create a input the n of variable is = n and here it will take input from user

i=1                                     #here the in strtaing the i value is 1  
for i in range (1,n+1):                 # here 1 for loop cteated and give if n range is 1 then add in n+1= 2 
 print(i)                               # printing the i for output
